publication titleSpoken Knowledge Organization by Semantic Structuring and a Prototype Course Lecture System for Personalized Learning
publication dateMar 11, 2014  publication descriptionIEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing

publication descriptionThis paper presents a new approach of spoken knowledge organization for course lectures for efficient personalized learning. Automatically extracted key terms are taken as the fundamental elements of the semantics of the course. Key term graph constructed by connecting related key terms forms the backbone of the global semantic structure. A preliminary prototype system has also been successfully developed.

publication titleUnsupervised Two-Stage Key Term Extraction from Spoken Documents by Topic Coherence and Support Vector Machine
publication dateMar 2012  publication descriptionIEEE ICASSP 2012

publication descriptionThis paper proposes an unsupervised two-stage approach to automatically extract keywords from spoken documents. In the Ô¨Årst stage, for each candidate term we compute a topic coherence and term signiÔ¨Åcance measure (TCS) based on probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) models. In the second stage, we take the candidate terms with highest and lowest TCS scores as positive and negative examples to train an SVM classiÔ¨Åer in an unsupervised way using prosodic, lexical, and semantic features, and then classify the candidate keyword using this SVM classiÔ¨Åer. The experiments with course lectures showed that the Ô¨Årst-stage offered very good precision, so the second-stage effectively extracted the keywords.

publication titleSpoken Lecture Summarization by Random Walk over a Graph Constructed with Automatically Extracted Key Terms
publication dateAug 2011  publication descriptionICSLP InterSpeech 2011

publication descriptionThis paper proposes an improved approach for spoken lecture summarization, in which random walk is performed on a graph constructed with automatically extracted key terms and probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA). Each sentence of the document is represented as a node of the graph and the edge between two nodes is weighted by the topical similarity between the two sentences. The basic idea is that sentences topically similar to more important sentences should be more important. In this way all sentences in the document can be jointly considered more globally rather than individually. Experimental results showed signiÔ¨Åcant improvement in terms of ROUGE evaluation.

publication titleAutomatic Key Term Extraction from Spoken Course Lectures Using Branching Entropy and Prosodic/Semantic Features
publication dateDec 2010  publication descriptionIEEE Spoken Language Technology (SLT) 2010

publication descriptionThis paper proposes a set of approaches to automatically extract key terms from spoken course lectures including audio signals, ASR transcriptions and slides. We divide the key terms into two types: key phrases and keywords and develop different approaches to extract them in order. We extract key phrases using right/left branching entropy and extract keywords by learning from three sets of features: prosodic features, lexical features and semantic features from Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA). The learning approaches include an unsupervised method (K-means exemplar) and two supervised ones (AdaBoost and neural network). Very encouraging preliminary results were obtained with a corpus of course lectures, and it is found that all approaches and all sets of features proposed here are useful.

publication titleSpoken Knowledge Organization by Semantic Structuring and a Prototype Course Lecture System for Personalized Learning
publication dateMar 11, 2014  publication descriptionIEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing

publication descriptionThis paper presents a new approach of spoken knowledge organization for course lectures for efficient personalized learning. Automatically extracted key terms are taken as the fundamental elements of the semantics of the course. Key term graph constructed by connecting related key terms forms the backbone of the global semantic structure. A preliminary prototype system has also been successfully developed.

Project nameDESIGN, CONTROL, OPTIMIZATION AND UTILIZATION OF ENERGY STORAGE FROM DRIVES AND PV SYSTEM IN AN INDUSTRIAL SETUP
Jan 2017 ‚Äì Present

Project descriptionIn a large number of Industries, drives are employed for supplying mechanical energy in order to control the motion of the motors connected to it. The drive then helps in accelerating the motor in order to reach required high speeds. After some time, the motor is required to be turned off and hence the drive applies a braking mechanism by which the motor decelerates to nil rpm and the energy stored by motor is wasted in the form of heat. Quite a lot of kinetic energy gets wasted for one motor. An industry has hundreds of such motors which would account for lots of energy which is being wasted to friction per day. Through this project, we could think of using some kind of regeneration mechanism in which this type of energy is stored in batteries and this type of energy can be used by the industry itself.
Modern industries also are planning to equip themselves with photovoltaic systems by installing solar panels on their rooftops in order to convert the solar energy into electricity that could be utilized in its own functioning. So, this solar energy can also be used to coupled with the energy from regeneration mechanism in order to be utilized by the industry for its working. We could predict and optimize the energy that is stored at a particular moment and the energy that needs to go in a long-term storage. In order to control the energy charging and discharging, we would learn characteristics of industrial process in order to effectively use this stored energy and incorporate this knowledge in the model predictive control system. We illustrate this type of control system by simulating it on Python using convex optimization schemes. 
Project nameMagnetostrictive Position sensor
Jul 2013 ‚Äì Present

Project descriptionMagnetostriction is a property in which application of a magnetic field causes strain resulting in changes in the size or shape of the material. By using magnetostrictive sensors, we can measure the position of an object. The main characteristic of magnetostrictive transducers is the absence of electric contact in the enclosure, thus there is no issue of wearing of any part of sensor. Other advantages include low cost, high reliability for longer durations, low non-linearity etc. This project possesses a widespread scope as the sensor I am developing is simple, economical, reliable & long life. It has various small and large scale applications such as knowing the piston position in cylinders, predicting an earthquake by detecting the changes occurring at large depths.

Project nameDesign of Instrumentation and Control Of Direct Contact Condensation (DCC) Studies Facility
May 2013 ‚Äì Jul 2013

Project descriptionIn thermal reactors of all designs, the phenomenon of Direct Contact Condensation (DCC) is encountered during normal, transient and accidental conditions. DCC is encountered at various critical locations within the reactor system. The phenomenon of DCC is characterized by heat and mass transport through a moving vapor-liquid interface. Consequently, DCC has been a relevant subject of investigation for design, operation, control and safety assessment of a number of reactor components and systems. An effort is made to design the Instrumentation and Control for the DCC Studies Facility. So preliminary detailing of measurements (in terms of nos., type and locations) has been carried out. Various configurations for PLC based SCADA system are proposed. Most suitable configuration suitable for the present facility has been suggested for implementation. All these details have been incorporated in the preliminary P&I Diagram of the Facility. Various Instrumentation Bus protocols have also been studied during the phase of this project.

Project nameControl of AC motor‚Äôs speed using AC Drives and PID Controller
Apr 2013

Project descriptionThe speed of motor is measured using a microcontroller which takes the output of a proximity sensor and gives it to PID controller which controls the speed of motor using AC drives. This project‚Äôs design is quite simple and hence can be used in very widespread applications.

While in this role, I have:
- Helped migrate from a system that only supported 1 city and country at a time to a system that works across unlimited number of cities and countries
- Designed and implemented a dynamic promotion system that allowed our marketing department to create all sorts of promotion campaigns
- Designed and implemented a passenger and driver referral system that helped boost new registrations
- Designed and implemented a fare and commission system that can be customized to support different type of vehicle pricing models
